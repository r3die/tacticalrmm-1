Any decent AV will flag the agent as a virus, since it technically is one due to the nature of this software. Adding the following exlucions will make sure everything works, including agent update: C:\\Program Files\\TacticalAgent\\* C:\\Program Files\\Mesh Agent\\* C:\\Windows\\Temp\\winagent-v*.exe C:\\Windows\\Temp\\trmm\\* C:\\temp\\tacticalrmm*.exe Dynamically generated executable \u00b6 The generated exe is simply a wrapper around the Manual install method, using a single exe/command without the need to pass any command line flags to the installer. All it does is download the generic installer from the agent's github release page and call it using predefined command line args that you choose from the web UI. It \"bakes\" the command line args into the executable. From the UI, click Agents > Install Agent You can also right click on a site > Install Agent . This will automatically fill in the client/site dropdown for you. Powershell \u00b6 The powershell method is very similar to the generated exe in that it simply downloads the installer from github and calls the exe for you. Manual \u00b6 The manual installation method requires you to first download the generic installer and call it using command line args. This is useful for scripting the installation using Group Policy or some other batch deployment method. Tip You can reuse the installer for any of the deployment methods, you don't need to constantly create a new installer for each new agent. The installer will be valid for however long you specify the token expiry time when generating an agent. Using a deployment link \u00b6 Creating a deployment link is the recommended way to deploy agents. The main benefit of this method is that the exectuable is generated only whenever the deployment download link is accessed, whereas with the other methods it's generated right away and the agent's version hardcoded into the exe. Using a deployment link will allow you to not worry about installing using an older version of an agent, which will fail to install if you have updated your RMM to a version that is not compatible with an older installer you might have lying around. To create a deployment, from the web UI click Agents > Manage Deployments . Tip Create a client/site named \"Default\" and create a deployment for it with a very long expiry to have a generic installer that can be deployed anytime at any client/site. You can then move the agent into the correct client/site from the web UI after it's been installed. Copy/paste the download link from the deployment into your browser. It will take a few seconds to dynamically generate the executable and then your browser will automatically download the exe. Optional installer args \u00b6 The following optional arguments can be passed to any of the installation method executables: -log debug Will print very verbose logging during agent install. Useful for troubleshooting agent install. -silent This will not popup any message boxes during install, either any error messages or the \"Installation was successfull\" message box that pops up at the end of a successfull install. -proxy \"http://proxyserver:port\" Use a http proxy -meshdir \"C:\\Program Files\\Your Company Name\\Mesh Agent\" Specify the full path to the directory containing MeshAgent.exe if using custom agent branding for your MeshCentral instance. -nomesh Do not install meshcentral agent during tactical agent install.

Attempting to run it on an existing server with other services will break things and the install will fail. Note The install script has been tested on the following public cloud providers: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, as well as behind NAT on Hyper-V, Proxmox and ESXi. Network Requirements \u00b6 A real (internet resolvable) domain is needed to generate a Let's Encrypt wildcard cert. If you cannot afford to purchase a domain ($12 a year) then you can get one for free at freenom.com example.local is NOT a real domain. No you don't have to expose your server to the internet A TOTP based authenticator app. Some popular ones are Google Authenticator, Authy and Microsoft Authenticator. Update Recommendations \u00b6 Note We highly recommend staying current with updates (at least every 3 months when you update your SSL certs is a good minimum) while Tactical RMM is still working towards its 1.0 release. Until we reach production release, there may be architectural changes that may be made to Tactical RMM and only a regular patching schedule is supported by developers. Option 1: Easy Install on a VPS \u00b6 Install on a VPS: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, BuyVM (highly recommended), Hetzner, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure to name a few Use something that meets minimum specs Run updates and setup the linux user \u00b6 SSH into the server as root . Download and run the prereqs and latest updates apt update apt install -y wget curl sudo apt -y upgrade If a new kernel is installed, then reboot the server with the reboot command Create a linux user named tactical to run the rmm and add it to the sudoers group. For Ubuntu : adduser tactical usermod -a -G sudo tactical For Debian : useradd -m -s /bin/bash tactical usermod -a -G sudo tactical Tip Enable passwordless sudo to make your life easier Note You will never login to the server again as root again unless something has gone horribly wrong, and you're working with the developers. Setup the firewall (optional but highly recommended) \u00b6 Info Skip this step if your VM is not publicly exposed to the world e.g. running behind NAT. You should setup the firewall rules in your router instead (ports 22, 443 and 4222 TCP). ufw default deny incoming ufw default allow outgoing ufw allow https ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 4222 Info SSH (port 22 tcp) is only required for you to remotely login and do basic linux server administration for your rmm. It is not needed for any agent communication. Allow ssh from everywhere ( not recommended) ufw allow ssh Allow ssh from only allowed IP's ( highly recommended) ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22 ufw allow proto tcp from X.X.X.X to any port 22 Enable and activate the firewall ufw enable && ufw reload Create the A records \u00b6 We'll be using example.com as our domain for this example. Info The RMM uses 3 different sites. The Vue frontend e.g. rmm.example.com which is where you'll be accesing your RMM from the browser, the REST backend e.g. api.example.com and Meshcentral e.g. mesh.example.com Get the public IP of your server with curl https://icanhazip.tacticalrmm.io Open the DNS manager of wherever the domain you purchased is hosted.

Replace example.com with your domain. Deploy the TXT record in your DNS manager for Lets Encrypt wildcard certs \u00b6 Warning TXT records can take anywhere from 1 minute to a few hours to propogate depending on your DNS provider. You should verify the TXT record has been deployed first before pressing Enter. A quick way to check is with the following command: dig -t txt _acme-challenge.example.com or test using: https://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/ Enter: _acme-challenge.example.com Create a login for the RMM web UI: A bunch of URLS / usernames / passwords will be printed out at the end of the install script. Save these somewhere safe. Recover them if you didn't Upload mesh agents \u00b6 Copy the url for the meshagent exe ( https://mesh.example.com/agentinvite?c=...... ), paste it in your browser and download the mesh agent: Navigate to https://rmm.example.com and login with the username/password you created during install. Once logged in, you will be redirected to the initial setup page. Create your first client/site, choose the default timezone and then upload the mesh agent you just downloaded.

Warning Use the contents included in this guide and apply the security settings detailed here at your own discretion. Intro \u00b6 This section is structured in three main subsections: Enabling GeoIP in NGINX config with the purpose of filtering (blocking) web requests based on the country\u2019s source IP. Enabling anti \u201cbad\u201d bots/referrers in HTTP requests to the NGINX server. Compiling and enabling ModSec + OWASP CRS in NGINX server. Each section can be enabled independently. Hardening NGINX settings \u00b6 GeoIP Integration in NGINX - Blocking Requests by Country Code \u00b6 Install required packages and NGINX module for GeoIP: # apt-get install geoip-database libgeoip1 libnginx-mod-http-geoip Verify that the GeoIP database files have been placed in the right location: # ls -lrt /usr/share/GeoIP/ total 10004 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8138841 Jan 24 2020 GeoIPv6.dat -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2099217 Jan 24 2020 GeoIP.dat Edit NGINX config file (\u201c/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\u201d) and add the following config under the \u201chttp {\u201c block: http { ## # Basic Settings ## # Load GeoIP Database geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat; The next settings will depend on the desired GeoIP blocking strategy. For \u201callow by default, deny by exception\u201d, the config would be: http { ## # Basic Settings ## # Load GeoIP Database geoip_country /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat; # map the list of denied countries map $geoip_country_code $allowed_country { default yes; # BLOCKED_COUNTRY_1 COUNTRY_CODE_1 no; # BLOCKED_COUNTRY_2 COUNTRY_CODE_2 no; # BLOCKED_COUNTRY_3 COUNTRY_CODE_3 no; } (The macro can be modified to achieve the \u201cdeny by default, allow by exception\u201d approach). Finally, the following \u201cif\u201d statement needs to be placed in all the vhosts where the GeoIP blocking should take effect, under the \u201clocation\u201d section: location / { root /var/www/rmm/dist; try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; add_header Cache-Control \"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\"; add_header Pragma \"no-cache\"; # block the country if ($allowed_country = no) { return 444; } } The HTTP Status = 444 is a good choice for NGINX not \u201cwasting\u201d too many resources in sending back the 4xx code to the client being blocked by GeoIP.

Finally, edit every vhost file (\u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/frontend.conf\u201d, \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rmm.conf\u201d and \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/meshcentral.conf\u201d) and place the following include statements under the \u201cserver\u201d block: server { listen 443 ssl; include /etc/nginx/bots.d/ddos.conf; include /etc/nginx/bots.d/blockbots.conf; Enabling ModSec in NGINX \u00b6 All steps in this section taken from the NGINX blog post \u201cCompiling and Installing ModSecurity for NGINX Open Source\u201d: https://www.nginx.com/blog/compiling-and-installing-modsecurity-for-open-source-nginx/ Install Prerequisite Packages \u00b6 The first step is to install the packages required to complete the remaining steps in this tutorial. Run the following command, which is appropriate for a freshly installed Ubuntu/Debian system. The required packages might be different for RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux. apt-get install -y apt-utils autoconf automake build-essential git libcurl4-openssl-dev libgeoip-dev liblmdb-dev libpcre++-dev libtool libxml2-dev libyajl-dev pkgconf wget zlib1g-dev Download and Compile the ModSecurity 3.0 Source Code \u00b6 With the required prerequisite packages installed, the next step is to compile ModSecurity as an NGINX dynamic module. In ModSecurity 3.0\u2019s new modular architecture, libmodsecurity is the core component which includes all rules and functionality. The second main component in the architecture is a connector that links libmodsecurity to the web server it is running with. There are separate connectors for NGINX, Apache HTTP Server, and IIS. We cover the NGINX connector in the next section. To compile libmodsecurity: Clone the GitHub repository: git clone --depth 1 -b v3/master --single-branch https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity Change to the ModSecurity directory and compile the source code: cd ModSecurity git submodule init git submodule update ./build.sh ./configure make make install cd .. The compilation takes about 15 minutes, depending on the processing power of your system. Note: It\u2019s safe to ignore messages like the following during the build process. Even when they appear, the compilation completes and creates a working object. fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything. Download the NGINX Connector for ModSecurity and Compile It as a Dynamic Module \u00b6 Compile the ModSecurity connector for NGINX as a dynamic module for NGINX. Clone the GitHub repository: git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx.git Determine which version of NGINX is running on the host where the ModSecurity module will be loaded: $ nginx -v nginx version: nginx/1.18.0 ( Ubuntu ) Download the source code corresponding to the installed version of NGINX (the complete sources are required even though only the dynamic module is being compiled): wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz tar zxvf nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz Compile the dynamic module and copy it to the standard directory for modules: cd nginx-1.18.0 ./configure --with-compat --add-dynamic-module = ../ModSecurity-nginx make modules cp objs/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /etc/nginx/modules cp objs/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /usr/share/nginx/modules/ cd .. Load the NGINX ModSecurity Connector Dynamic Module \u00b6 Add the following load_module directive to the main (top\u2011level) context in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. It instructs NGINX to load the ModSecurity dynamic module when it processes the configuration: load_module modules/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so; Configure and Enable ModSecurity \u00b6 The final step is to enable and test ModSecurity. Set up the appropriate ModSecurity configuration file. Here we\u2019re using the recommended ModSecurity configuration provided by TrustWave Spiderlabs, the corporate sponsors of ModSecurity. mkdir /etc/nginx/modsec wget -P /etc/nginx/modsec/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/v3/master/modsecurity.conf-recommended mv /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf To guarantee that ModSecurity can find the unicode.mapping file (distributed in the top\u2011level ModSecurity directory of the GitHub repo), copy it to /etc/nginx/modsec. cp ModSecurity/unicode.mapping /etc/nginx/modsec Change the SecRuleEngine directive in the configuration to change from the default \u201cdetection only\u201d mode to actively dropping malicious traffic. #SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly SecRuleEngine On Enabling OWASP Core Rule Set \u00b6 Clone OWASP CRS: cd /etc/nginx/modsec git clone https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset.git Create CRS setup config file: cp /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf.example /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf Edit config file and enable a paranoia level of 2 (comment out section below and modify the paranoia level from 1 - default to 2): SecAction \\ \"id:900000,\\ phase:1,\\ nolog,\\ pass,\\ t:none,\\ setvar:tx.paranoia_level=2\" A Paranoia level of 2 is a good combination of security rules to load by the ModSec engine while keeping low the number of false positives. The OWASP CRS team carried out some tests using BURP against ModSec + OWASP CRS: Create ModSecurity base config file (\u201c/etc/nginx/modsec/modsec-base-cfg.conf\u201d) and include the following lines (the order is important) : Include /etc/nginx/modsec/modsecurity.conf Include /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/crs-setup.conf Include /etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/rules/*.conf Enable ModSec in all NGINX enabled sites: \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/frontend.conf\u201d, \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rmm.conf\u201d and \u201c/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/meshcentral.conf\u201d: server { modsecurity on; modsecurity_rules_file /etc/nginx/modsec/modsec-base-cfg.conf; \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Tactical RMM custom rules: Access to the admin UI (front-end): We apply the \u201cdeny by default, allow by exception\u201d principle, whereby only a set of predefined public IPs should be allowed to access the UI API and Meshcentral: RMM agents and RMM UI (as referrer while an admin session is active) make web calls that get blocked by the OWASP CRS, specifically PUT, POST and PATCH methods. These three methods can be \u201cwhitelisted\u201d when the requested URI matches legitimate requests. Connection to Meshcentral during Tactical agent install. Create a .conf file under \u201c/etc/nginx/modsec/coreruleset/rules\u201d named \u201cRMM-RULES.conf\u201d, for example, with the following content: #ADMIN UI/FRONTEND ACCESS - DENY BY DEFAULT, ALLOW BY EXCEPTION SecRule SERVER_NAME \"rmm.EXAMPLE.COM\" \"id:1001,phase:1,nolog,msg:'Remote IP Not allowed',deny,chain\" ### ALLOWED PUBLIC IP 1 ######### SecRule REMOTE_ADDR \"!@eq IP1\" chain ### ALLOWED PUBLIC IP 2 ######### SecRule REMOTE_ADDR \"!@eq IP2\" \"t:none\" #API AND MESHCENTRAL - WHITELIST PUT, PATCH AND POST METHODS BY REQUESTED URI SecRule REQUEST_URI \"@beginsWith /api/v3/checkin\" \"id:1002,phase:1,t:none,nolog,allow,chain\" SecRule REQUEST_METHOD \"PUT|PATCH\" \"t:none\" SecRule REQUEST_URI \"@beginsWith /api/v3/checkrunner\" \"chain,id:'1003',phase:1,t:none,nolog,allow\" SecRule REQUEST_METHOD \"PATCH\" \"t:none\" SecRule REQUEST_URI \"@beginsWith /alerts/alerts\" \"chain,id:'1004',phase:1,t:none,nolog,allow\" SecRule REQUEST_METHOD \"PATCH\" \"t:none\" SecRule REQUEST_URI \"@beginsWith /agents/listagents\" \"chain,id:'1005',phase:1,t:none,nolog,allow\" SecRule REQUEST_METHOD \"PATCH\" \"t:none\" SecRule REQUEST_URI \"@beginsWith /api/v3/sysinfo\" \"chain,id:'1006',phase:1,t:none,nolog,allow\" SecRule REQUEST_METHOD \"PATCH\" \"t:none\" SecRule REQUEST_URI \"@beginsWith /api/v3/winupdates\" \"chain,id:'1007',phase:1,t:none,nolog,allow\" SecRule REQUEST_METHOD \"POST\" ##REQUIRED FOR MANAGEMENT ACTIONS FROM ADMIN/FRONT-END UI.

Here is a basic Traefik config with docker-composer note the file.directory and file.watch are important. version: \"3.7\" services: traefik: container_name: traefik24 image: traefik:v2.4 restart: unless-stopped command: - --entryPoints.http.address = :80 - --entryPoints.https.address = :443 - --providers.docker = true - --providers.docker.endpoint = unix:///var/run/docker.sock - --providers.docker.defaultrule = HostHeader ( ` {{ index .Labels \"com.docker.compose.service\" }} . $DOMAINNAME ` ) ## This is important, to load the config for RMM and Mesh - --providers.file.directory = rules # Load dynamic configuration from one or more .toml or .yml files in a directory. - --providers.file.watch = true # Only works on top level files in the rules folder #### - --certificatesresolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnschallenge = true - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.email = $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.storage = /acme.json - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnsChallenge.provider = cloudflare - --certificatesResolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnsChallenge.resolvers = 1 .1.1.1:53,1.0.0.1:53 ports: - target: 80 published: 80 protocol: tcp mode: host - target: 443 published: 443 protocol: tcp mode: host volumes: ##The rules that we will load## - $USERDIR /docker/traefik2/rules:/rules ## - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro - $USERDIR /docker/traefik2/acme/acme.json:/acme.json - $USERDIR /docker/traefik2/traefik.log:/traefik.log environment: - CF_API_EMAIL = $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL - CF_API_KEY = $CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY labels: - \"traefik.enable=true\" # HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirect - \"traefik.http.routers.http-catchall.entrypoints=http\" - \"traefik.http.routers.http-catchall.rule=HostRegexp(`{host:.+}`)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.http-catchall.middlewares=redirect-to-https\" - \"traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https\" # HTTP Routers - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.entrypoints=https\" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.rule=HostHeader(`traefik. $DOMAINNAME `)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.tls=true\" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.tls.domains[0].main= $DOMAINNAME \" - \"traefik.http.routers.traefik-rtr.tls.domains[0].sans=*. $DOMAINNAME \" Before proceding, we need to change the port 443 to 4430 and 80 to 800 because the port 443 and 80 are alredy used by Traefik. Here is a snippet of the only thing you should modify into docker-compose file of the installation. # container for tactical reverse proxy tactical-nginx: container_name: trmm-nginx image: ${ IMAGE_REPO } tactical-nginx: ${ VERSION } restart: always environment: APP_HOST: ${ APP_HOST } API_HOST: ${ API_HOST } MESH_HOST: ${ MESH_HOST } CERT_PUB_KEY: ${ CERT_PUB_KEY } CERT_PRIV_KEY: ${ CERT_PRIV_KEY } networks: proxy: ipv4_address: 172 .20.0.20 ports: - \"800:80\" ## port 800 instead of 80 - \"4430:443\" ## port 4430 instead of 443 Once save, make sure you run the docker-compose or installation script at least once, so all the directory structure are created. Once you have your certificate (acme.json) generated by traefikv2 we will be able to extract it for rmm. Copy the acme.json create by traefik into the root of your rmm directory (In my case its $USERDIR/docker/rmm) which you should have already define. After that we can run this docker to extract the certificates for us. version: \"3.7\" services: ##Copy the acme.json of Traefik2 at volumes: (userdir/docker/rmm in this case) traefik-certs-dumper: image: ldez/traefik-certs-dumper:v2.7.4 entrypoint: sh -c ' apk add jq ; while ! [ -e /data/acme.json ] || ! [ `jq \".[] | .Certificates | length\" /data/acme.json` != 0 ]; do sleep 1 ; done && traefik-certs-dumper file --version v2 --watch --source /data/acme.json --dest data/certs' volumes: - $USERDIR /docker/rmm:/data Once completed, you should have 1 new folder into you rmm directory $USERDIR/docker/rmm/ certs in this example. As the installation instruction, we will pass those to the .env echo \"CERT_PUB_KEY= $( sudo base64 -w 0 $USERDIR /docker/rmm/certs/certs/**yourdomaine.com.crt** ) \" >> .env echo \"CERT_PRIV_KEY= $( sudo base64 -w 0 $USERDIR /docker/rmm/certs/private/**yourdomaine.com.key** ) \" >> .env Next we can create 3 rules to tell traefik to correctly route the https and agent For that we will create 2 rules into traefik directory as per it configuration. folder/traefik/rules create nano app-mesh.toml and inside it we add [ http.routers ] [ http.routers.mesh-rtr ] entryPoints = [ \"https\" ] rule = \"Host(`mesh.**yourdomain.com**`)\" service = \"mesh-svc\" ##middleware with 2fa [ http.services ] [ http.services.mesh-svc ] [ http.services.mesh-svc.loadBalancer ] passHostHeader = true [[ http.services.mesh-svc.loadBalancer.servers ]] url = \"https://**xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx**:4430\" # or whatever your external host's IP is create nano app-meshagent.toml and inside it we add [ http.routers ] [ http.routers.mesh-rtr1 ] entryPoints = [ \"https\" ] rule = \"\"\"Host(`mesh.**yourdomain.com**`) && PathPrefix( `/agent.ashx`, `/meshrelay.ashx`, ) && Headers(`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `wss`) \"\"\" ##Don't add middle where, the agent wont work. [ http.services ] [ http.services.mesh-svc1 ] [ http.services.mesh-svc.loadBalancer ] passHostHeader = true [[ http.services.mesh-svc1.loadBalancer.servers ]] url = \"https://**xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx**:4430\" # or whatever your external host's IP is create nano app-rmm.toml and inside it we add [ http.routers ] [ http.routers.rmm-rtr ] entryPoints = [ \"https\" ] rule = \"Host(`rmm.**yourdomain.com**`)\" service = \"rmm-svc\" ##middleware with 2fa [ http.services ] [ http.services.rmm-svc ] [ http.services.rmm-svc.loadBalancer ] passHostHeader = true [[ http.services.rmm-svc.loadBalancer.servers ]] url = \"https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:4430\" # or whatever your external host's IP:port is That it, you can now restart Tactical rmm and mesh.yourdomain.com should work, same for the agent. Please note that if you have a middleware with 2FA you can still use it with the inside mesh.toml but do not add it with the agent.

You need to add the certificate private key and public keys to the following files: /etc/nginx/sites-available/rmm.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/meshcentral.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/frontend.conf /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py create a new folder for certs and allow tactical user permissions (assumed to be tactical) sudo mkdir /certs sudo chown -R tactical:tactical /certs\" Now move your certs into that folder. Open the api file and add the api certificate or if its a wildcard the directory should be /certs/EXAMPLE.COM/ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/rmm.conf replace ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/EXAMPLE.COM/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/EXAMPLE.COM/privkey.pem; with ssl_certificate /certs/api.EXAMPLE.COM/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /certs/api.EXAMPLE.COM/privkey.pem; Repeat the process for /etc/nginx/sites-available/meshcentral.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/frontend.conf but change api. to: mesh. and rmm. respectively. Add the following to the last lines of /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py nano /rmm/api/tacticalrmm/tacticalrmm/local_settings.py add CERT_FILE = \"/certs/api.EXAMPLE.COM/fullchain.pem\" KEY_FILE = \"/certs/api.EXAMPLE.COM/privkey.pem\" Regenerate Nats Conf cd /rmm/api/tacticalrmm source ../env/bin/activate python manage.py reload_nats Restart services sudo systemctl restart rmm celery celerybeat nginx nats nats-api Use certbot to do acme challenge over http \u00b6 The standard SSL cert process in Tactical uses a DNS challenge that requires dns txt files to be updated in your public DNS with every cert renewal. The below script uses http challenge on the 3 separate ssl certs, one for each subdomain: rmm, api, mesh. They still have the same 3 month expiry. Restart the Tactical RMM server about every 2.5 months (80 days) for auto-renewed certs to become active. Note Your Tactical RMM server will need to have TCP Port: 80 exposed to the internet #!/bin/bash ###Set colours same as Tactical RMM install and Update YELLOW = '\\033[1;33m' GREEN = '\\033[0;32m' RED = '\\033[0;31m' NC = '\\033[0m' ### Ubuntu 20.04 Check UBU20 = $( grep 20 .04 \"/etc/\" * \"release\" ) if !

Here is a snippet of the only thing you should modify into docker-compose file of the installation. # container for tactical reverse proxy tactical-nginx: container_name: trmm-nginx image: ${ IMAGE_REPO } tactical-nginx: ${ VERSION } restart: always environment: APP_HOST: ${ APP_HOST } API_HOST: ${ API_HOST } MESH_HOST: ${ MESH_HOST } CERT_PUB_KEY: ${ CERT_PUB_KEY } CERT_PRIV_KEY: ${ CERT_PRIV_KEY } networks: proxy: ipv4_address: 172 .20.0.20 ports: - \"800:80\" ## port 800 instead of 80 - \"4430:443\" ## port 4430 instead of 443 Once save, make sure you run the docker-compose or installation script at least once, so all the directory structure are created. Once you have your certificate (acme.json) generated by traefikv2 we will be able to extract it for rmm. Copy the acme.json create by traefik into the root of your rmm directory (In my case its $USERDIR/docker/rmm) which you should have already define. After that we can run this docker to extract the certificates for us. version: \"3.7\" services: ##Copy the acme.json of Traefik2 at volumes: (userdir/docker/rmm in this case) traefik-certs-dumper: image: ldez/traefik-certs-dumper:v2.7.4 entrypoint: sh -c ' apk add jq ; while !
